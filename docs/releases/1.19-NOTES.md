## Release notes for kops 1.19 series

(The kops 1.19 release has not been released yet; this is a document to gather the notes prior to the release).

# Significant changes

* On AWS kops now defaults to using launch templates instead of launch configurations.

* Clusters using the Amazon VPC CNI provider now perform an `ec2.DescribeInstanceTypes` call at instance launch time. In large clusters or AWS accounts this may lead to API throttling which could delay node readiness. If this becomes a problem please open a GitHub issue.
  
# Breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes 1.9 and 1.10 has been removed.

* Support for the Romana networking provider has been removed.

# Required Actions

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.11 and 1.12 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.20.

# Full change list since 1.18.0 release
